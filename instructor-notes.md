## Setup

To setup this lesson you will need
to create a `git-training-demo`
repository using the
[zipped directory](data/git-training-demo.zip)
we provide.

1. Download the [zipped directory](data/git-training-demo.zip).
2. Unzip the directory on your system.
3. Edit the `CITATION.cff` file so the
GitHub repository url is correct for
your organisation.
4. Initialise the git repository locally.
5. Add all files and commit.
6. Create an empty GitHub repo with the
   name `git-training-demo`.
7. Link your local repo to the remote and
   push all changes.
8. Setup a rule to require a PR before
   merging with `main`.

Pay particular attention to the instructor
callouts in episodes [05](../episodes/05-forks.md)
and [08](../episodes/08-rebase.md)
which outline how to create the conflicts
the learners will have to resolve.
