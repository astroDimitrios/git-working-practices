::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Create an Issue with the correct labels.
- Assign yourself to an Issue.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What information should go on an Issue?
- What are Issue templates?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

GitHub Issues (tickets) are where you plan and track work.
You can assign individuals to Issues and label them with a
relevant tag such as `bug` or `enhancement`.
Before opening a new Issue check whether there is already
one open for the feature or bug by using GitHub's search.

Here's some advice for writing good Issues:

- Be clear and concise, provide plenty of detail
- State the expected outcomes
- Tag relevant collaborators
- Break up large Issues into several small ones and or
  use checklists to track tasks in the Issue

Open an Issue on the `git-training-demo` repository 
to add a file stating your favourite cloud type.

Navigate to the **Issues** tab:

![](fig/github-fork-issue-open.png){alt='A screenshot of the git-training-demo repository showing the Issues view.'}

This repositories Issue tab looks different to the `weather`
repository you worked on in the Introduction to Git & GitHub lesson.
It uses [Issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)
to provide templates for bugs and feature requests.
Click on the green **Get started** button next to the
**Feature request** option:

![](fig/github-fork-issue-1.jpeg){alt='A screenshot of the git-training-demo repository showing an Issue being opened. The template has automatically added text to the description and labelled the Issue as an enhancement.'}

You can see the Issue has text in the description already.
This is from the template which provides a consistent
structure to the Issues on this repo.
The template has also added the `enhancement` label for you.

Add in a clear title such as
"Add mo-fitzroy's favourite cloud type",
replace 'mo-fitzroy' with your GitHub username.
Click **Submit new issue**.

It's a good idea to remind learners that
images can be dropped straight into the
Issue description.
An image of a cloud should do!

### Projects, milestones, and labels

Your instructor has set up a Project and some custom milestones
for you to add to your Issue.

- [Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels)
  help you classify Issues and PRs.
- [Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)
  group Issues and PRs, tracking their progress towards a common milestone automatically.
- [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
  are a tool for planning and tracking work via GitHub.
  Multiple repositories can be linked to a single project.
  Projects can have multiple views depending on your needs;
  some have kanban boards and gantt charts, others separate out
  an individual colleagues Issues to avoid clutter.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Assign yourself, a project, and a milestone to your Issue

On the right hand side of the Issue you can:

1. Assign yourself to the Issue so that others know
you are working on it.
2. Add the Issue to a Project by clicking on the cog
next to the Projects section. (If you don't see a project
related to the training you might not have been granted permissions, 
ask your instructors for help)
3. Assign the Issue to a milestone.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Issues are used to track and plan work.
- Issue templates provide template text
  for the first comment for new Issues of various types.
  They can auto-label Issues and encourage collaborators
  to give plenty of detail.
