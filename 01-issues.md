::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

GitHub Issues (tickets) are where you plan and track work.
You can assign individuals to Issues and label them with a
relevant tag such as `bug` or `enhancement`.
Before opening a new Issue check whether there is already
one open for the feature or bug by using GitHub's search.

Here's some advice for writing good Issues:

- Be clear and concise, provide plenty of detail
- State the expected outcomes
- Tag relevant collaborators
- Break up large Issues into several small ones and or
  use checklists to track tasks in the Issue
