title: Learner Profiles
---

A profile is a fictional portrayal of a typical user of a product or service.
Each profile represents a group of users.
Most projects have more than one profile,
to demonstrate the complexity of needs, preferences
and potential barriers different user groups face.

The numerous profiles listed below reflect the extensive partnerships the
Met Office holds across the globe,
and therefore the many user groups this training caters for.

These profiles were created to ensure that the course meets the needs
of our user groups, and to inform instructors.
As a learner they are here for informational purposes only.

## Why Use Profiles?

Profiles are used to: 

- promote empathy
- increase awareness and memorability of users
- prioritise features
- inform design decisions
- promote equality and diversity

Profiles can be used to test whether the product or service meets the specific needs and expectations of key user groups. 


## Profiles

Amina is a researcher collaborating with the office to develop Jules. She uses fcm and svn because she has to. When the JULES docs moved to git/GitHub she tried to start learning git/GitHub to contribute to the docs but was unsure where to start and what courses to take. Amina and her colleagues frequently use the JASMIN computer and want to know how the new ways of working with Git and GitHub will apply to their use of JASMIN.

Joshua is a scientific software engineer working on LFRic in the CCD team. He uses fcm mainly and doesn't really touch svn. Joshua is comfortable using GitHub as some of his projects are already on GitHub. He has questions about working practices after the big codes have migrated. When working on the GitHub hosted LFRic documentation he uses the version control features of his IDE, PyCharm.

Carlton is a scientific software engineer in Ocean Forecasting R&D. He is already thinking about the migration and supporting colleagues learning git basics. Carlton has a need for git/GitHub documentation and training, he is considering making his own. Carlton has questions about working practices after the big codes have migrated. He wants more bite sized and modular training on advanced Git/GitHub topics which could be delivered together in a days session for his team.

Mina is a scientist working on JEDI related projects. Her team has already migrated most of their code to git/GitHub and is dual using fcm and git whilst migrating their last few repositories. Mina is learning about more advanced features of git/GitHub and exclusively uses the command line to interact with any JEDI git repositories. She would prefer to learn from short videos that she can access anytime.

Alexis is a Science Manager. They manage a large team and several projects with technical and scientific documentation currently spread between trac pages, SharePoint, and OneNote. Alexis needs to work out how documentation will be migrated and would like to learn how to use GitHub to effectively manage her projects and team. They have also requested dedicated support for their team to help them migrate.

Cora is an apprentice studying climate policy and has little to no experience with programming / computer science. She will be running various climate workflows and codes as part of Alexis' team. Cora doesn't know what version control is and would like to take an in person course and to have the materials available online so she can refer back anytime. She has been picking up bits of fcm as she starts her apprenticeship.

Clarabella is a new starter to the office in Technology. They only know how to use git/GitHub but have had some very basic srs/fcm training. Clarabella needs to learn how we use GitHub at the Met Office and her manager suggested they find more advanced training on topics such as GitHub actions for their project. She's proficient with Linux and has some experience with VSCode but not its version control features and extensions.

Maxine is a scientist mainly working on climate policy. They use fcm once in a blue moon to contribute to small repos / scripts that they maintain. Maxine needs training on git/GitHub but is very bust so has little time to engage with training or the migration project. She would like a demonstration or walkthrough of how to migrate her repositories and scripts, preferably from an expert and in-person.

Ziki is a prolific developer of core Met Office codes. He has limited experience of git/GitHub and needs to know how development processes will work when the code migrates to git/GitHub. Ziki has very little CPD time that could be used for training due to other science commitments. Ziki is nervous about making mistakes due to his time constraints and would like to know where to look to troubleshoot problems.

Raven is a scientist working on the UM at a MOAP partner organisation. They only learn via written documentation with clear examples. Raven is currently working on several grant proposals and papers so has limited time to engage with us. Raven needs the benefits of migration emphasised and clear written documentation/training on how to use git/GitHub both in general and for the UM.

Tatsuya is a PhD student working on a regional UM configuration. Their supervisor has asked them to get the UM model running on their HPC and doesn't know where to start. They learnt git/GitHub at university but are unsure what our working practices are and where to look for help. Tatsuya hates learning through videos and would like to attend hand on support sessions to supplement any written documentation.

Carmine is a scientist working at a MOAP partner institution in Oceania and does her data analysis primarily with R on Windows. They want to learn how to use Git and GitHub effectively on Windows with RStudio. They have very little experience with SVN and trac and no experience with Git and GitHub. She would like to understand more about version control and why it is important. They aren't comfortable asking questions in a public forum so would like a private support channel to ask questions.

Ceri works part time in programmes on climate related work. They are familiar with FCM and trac, having done some development of rose suites previously, but have only limited experience of Git and are not confident yet. They work fully remotely from Llanelli so require remote, direct instruction, during their work hours. They would also like a cheat sheet for Git/GitHub and clear step-by-step instructions on migration and new working practices with examples.
