This marks the end of the the workshop.
Please remember to fill out your post-workshop feedback.
This feedback is vital for us to keep improving the lesson
for other learners.

Episodes after this **End** page are optional.
Your instructor may choose to teach these episodes
if time permits.
Otherwise feel free to work through the episodes
in your own time.

### Decision Time

What will the working practices look like for your repositories?
Things to think about:

- Who needs access to your repos? Should there be a second admin to help you?
  Review [Episode 1](../episodes/00-repo-access.md) Repository Access.
- What branching model will you use?
  Review [Episode 3](../episodes/03-feature-branch.md) Branching Models.
- Will you use forks with your branching model?
  Review [Episode 3 Forks](../episodes/02-branching.md#forking)
- Who presses the merge button as part of a Pull Request,
  the developer or the reviewer?
- Will you need Issue and Pull Request templates
  or other project management features such as milestones and Projects?
- What automated tests might help your development process?

Don't try and make all these decisions at once!
Revisit the material and seek out further advice if needed before deciding.
Remember you can change your mind anytime and evolve your working practices
as your projects grow.

### Where to next?

We've covered a lot over the last two workshops
but there is always more to learn especially
when it comes to GitHub!

- [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/github/) has a wide variety of
  GitHub training.
- In this lesson you saw automated testing
  of PRs using [GitHub Actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github-actions/) which you might like to explore more.
- The optional [rebasing episode](./08-rebase.md) guides you through rebasing a branch.
- Your Pull Requests ran automated tests using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) checks which you can set up locally to run before you commit.
  The optional [pre-commit episode](./09-pre-commit.md) outlines how to set up some basic checks.
