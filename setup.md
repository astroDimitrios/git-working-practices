## Pre-workshop Survey

Please remember to fill out the pre-workshop survey prior
to the start of the workshop.
This information is vital for us to keep improving the lesson
for other learners.

## Give Your GitHub Username to the Instructors

In this lesson you will be working on a new repository,
called `git-training-demo`, which your instructors have set up for you.
If you are working through this material as part of a workshop
your instructors will ask you to provide them with your
GitHub username, no other setup is required.

If you are working through this material in your own time
you will need to be provided with repository permissions for Episodes 1-5.
Met Office colleagues should request membership to the
[`git-and-github-training` GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/MetOffice/teams/git-and-github-training).
Met Office partners should email the
[Science Git Migration Project](mailto:ScienceGitMigrationProjectSupport@metoffice.gov.uk) with the subject: **GH WP Training Permissions Request**,
please include your GitHub username in the email.
Please be patient when you arrive at Episode 5 Review
as you will need to wait for an instructor to review your changes.
