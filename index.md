In this course you will be learning how to effectively collaborate
with colleagues using Git and GitHub.
Good working practices help us avoid mistakes,
keep our codebases secure,
and help us write sustainable code.
Having clear practices for contributing to your
repository encourages outside collaborators to
contribute to your work.
In this lesson we'll look at what good practice using
Git and GitHub might look like.

One process to develop new code with Git and GitHub
looks like this:

1. Open an Issue describing the feature or bug
2. Create a branch to develop your changes on
3. Make changes to your working copy
4. Write tests
5. Write documentation
6. Open a Pull Request
7. Review your changes
8. Merge the Pull Request and close the Issue
9. Tidy up your branches

During this workshop you will practice collaborating
using a similar albeit simplified process on a test repository
your instructors have set up.
By the end of the course you should have the skills and knowledge
to decide what working practices are best for you and your team.

## Prerequisites

In this lesson we use Git from the Unix Shell.
Some previous experience with the shell is expected,
*but isn't mandatory*.

This is a follow up course from the
[Version Control with Git](https://www.astropython.com/git-novice/)
lesson. Please ensure you are comfortable with the
