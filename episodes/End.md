### Where to next?

We've covered a lot over the last two workshops
but there is always more to learn especially
when it comes to GitHub!

- [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/github/) has a wide variety of
  GitHub training.
- In this lesson you saw automated testing
  of PRs using [GitHub Actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github-actions/) which you might like to explore more.
- These tests ran [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) checks which you can set up locally to run before you commit.
